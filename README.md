This project involves analyzing movie ratings data to build a recommendation system using item-based collaborative filtering. Initially, datasets containing movie titles and user ratings were imported and merged to create a comprehensive movie ratings DataFrame. The dataset was then explored to understand distribution patterns and rating statistics. Visualization revealed insights into movie rating frequencies and counts. For collaborative filtering, the project focused on the 'Titanic (1997)' movie, constructing a user-item matrix and calculating correlations with other movies to identify similar films based on user ratings. This approach aimed to leverage similarity measures to suggest movies that are highly correlated with 'Titanic', enhancing the recommendation system's accuracy and relevance.
